# SteamVideoGames_DataCleaning
Dataset provided by https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tamber/steam-video-games/data.

Facing issue with computational limit. Might bring back this project later on. 

Initially trying to create recommendation system using this dataset.
However, the data lacks of genre of games. 
Having the idea of connecting to Steam's API and retrieve the Game ID and Genre of the Game. 
By using the code attached in the repository, with or without parallizing the thread in order to improve the performance of matching the game names, it still stay very slow. The estimated time for the whole process is about 270 hours. 
Thus, this project is being postponed until a solution come out.
